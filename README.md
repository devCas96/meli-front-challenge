## Technical decisions

### NEXTJS

- NextJS was the best suitable option for this project because need to take advantage of **SSR**, **performance**, and **SEO**.
- NextJS components are server components by default but also we can have client components and our **Header** is an excellent example of a client component
- NextJS provides a way to handle our owns APIs throught **API Routes**.
- NextJS v14 also provides features with **App router** to have a best page handlers including **loadings** (skeleton approach here), **layouts**, **errors**.

### PLAYWRIGHT

- As we can see upper, Playwright provides a powerful group of tools to write concise and efficent e2e tests.

### üìùNOTES

- **Atomic Design** (focused on reusability and to compose big components by smaller ones).
- **Home page component** empty because Home needs to render just the root layout that contains the header.
- **Header component** is a client component and it allows us to have a check before send the search input value to server.
- **Loading components** implementing skeleton by page.
- **Cloudinary CDN** used for fast delivery icons and resources from client. (the only env value in this project is the Cloudinary id).
- Server images with **next/image**.
- Meli endpoints added to **constants** and not to **env** because are public resources and there aren't reasons to protect them.
- **Dynamic Error Component** implemented for receive any kind of error and render a message.
- **Accesibility** improved with aria attributes.
- **Conventional commits** implemented to have clear commits and follow the best practices.
- **PNPM** as default package manager.
